Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package is a document manager for `mongo-connector <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector>`_.

The easiest way to get started is to install solr-doc-manager at the same time
as mongo-connector with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__::

  pip install mongo-connector[solr]

If you already have mongo-connector installed, install solr-doc-manager via::

  pip install solr-doc-manager

You can also install the development version of solr-doc-manager
manually::

  git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/solr-doc-manager
  cd solr-doc-manager
  python setup.py install

You may have to run ``python setup.py install`` with ``sudo``, depending
on where you're installing mongo-connector and what privileges you have.

For information on running mongo-connector with Solr, please see https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/Usage%20with%20Solr

.. note:: Please note that before mongo-connector version 2.5.0, the Solr doc manager was packaged with mongo-connector.

Running the tests
-----------------
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Copy of the solr-doc-manager Github repository

  The tests are not included in the package from PyPI and can only be acquired by cloning this repository on Github::

      git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/solr-doc-manager

2. Solr

  The integration tests require Solr to be running. To set up and run Solr::

      curl -O http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/4.9.1/solr-4.9.1.tgz
      tar -zxf solr-4.9.1.tgz
      cp mongo_connector/doc_managers/schema.xml solr-4.9.1/example/solr/collection1/conf/
      cd solr-4.9.1/example/ && java -Djetty.port=8983 -Dsolr.solr.home=solr -jar start.jar > /dev/null 2>&1 &

  Solr will be running on http://localhost:8983/solr

3. Mongo Orchestration

  Mongo Connector runs MongoDB on its own using another tool called `Mongo Orchestration <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-orchestration>`__. This package should install automatically if you run ``python setup.py test``, but the Mongo Orchestration server still needs to be started manually before running the tests::

      mongo-orchestration --bind 127.0.0.1 --config orchestration.config start

  will start the server. To stop it::

      mongo-orchestration --bind 127.0.0.1 --config orchestration.config stop

  The location of the MongoDB server should be set in orchestration.config. For more information on how to use Mongo Orchestration, or how to use it with different arguments, please look at the Mongo-Orchestration README.

4. Environment variables

  There are a few influential environment variables that affect the tests. These are:

    - ``DB_USER`` is the username to use if running the tests with authentication enabled.
    - ``DB_PASSWORD`` is the password for the above.
    - ``MONGO_PORT`` is the starting port for running MongoDB. Future nodes will be started on sequentially increasing ports.
    - ``SOLR_URL`` is the address on which Solr is running.
    - ``MO_ADDRESS`` is the address to use for Mongo Orchestration (i.e. hostname:port)

All the tests live in the `tests` directory.

Running tests on the command-line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the tests take care of setting up and tearing down MongoDB clusters on their own, make sure to start Solr before doing a full test run!

You can run all the tests with one command (this works in all supported Python versions)::

  python setup.py test

In addition, you can be more selective with which tests you run (in Python > 2.6 only)! For example, if you only wanted to run the Solr doc manager tests::

  python -m unittest tests.test_solr_doc_manager

Error messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the tests are meant to generate lots of ``ERROR``-level log messages, especially the rollback tests. mongo-connector logs exceptions it encounters while iterating the cursor in the oplog, so we see these in the console output while MongoDB clusters are being torn apart in the tests. As long as all the tests pass with an `OK` message, all is well.
